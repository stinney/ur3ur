An experimental project to create richly annotated corpus of Ur III Ur texts.

This project is a public working space in which I am developing my ideas and 
approaches for computational analysis of Ur III texts.  The first stage is to
produce a reliable lemmatized corpus of Ur III texts from Ur.

This is on the one hand part of my activity on the Penn/British Museum 
project "Digitizing Woolley's Ur", and on the other a first step towards a 
systematic machine translation system for the Ur III corpus.
